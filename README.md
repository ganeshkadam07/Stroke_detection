Background
Stroke is a critical medical condition that requires timely intervention. Early detection and prediction of stroke risk can help medical professionals prioritize individuals for further assessment and reduce the chances of severe complications. This project aims to develop a machine learning model that can predict the likelihood of stroke based on various factors.

Data
The dataset used for training and testing the stroke detection model is provided by Kaggle. It contains a collection of features including age, gender, hypertension, heart disease, marital status, work type, residence type, average glucose level, body mass index (BMI), and smoking status. The dataset also includes a binary label indicating whether a stroke occurred or not.

Model
The stroke detection model is built using [Python programming language] and [machine learning library]. The model is developed using a [machine learning algorithm], which is trained on the provided dataset. [Brief explanation of the chosen algorithm and its suitability for the task].
